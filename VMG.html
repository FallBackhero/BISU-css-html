        <li class="c2">Responsiveness to Challenges. As a newfound institution of higher learning, BISU is faced with all the challenges demanded particularly the continuing depletion of the national governments’ financial support along with BISU’s desire for upgrading its facilities and human resources. Being intellectually diverse and entrepreneurial, creative and innovative, BISU shall beat the odds by capitalizing on creative collaborations with its individual campuses, the community, local government units and other sectors available.</li>
        <li class="c3">Student Access. Being a state-owned university, BISU is committed to providing public service, by becoming a university that is open and accessible to all students who merit entrance.

        <li class="c4">Public Engagement. Expresses BISU’s commitment to search for knowledge-based solutions to societal and economic problems particularly of Bohol and of the region. Public engagement is the interpretation of BISU’s commitment to research and extension by being proactive in introducing changes that will deeply impact on the improvement of the life of the people.</li>
        <li class="c5">Good Governance. Alongside the current regime’s objectives of good governance in the delivery of basic services, BISU shall strive to institutionalize a streamlined, efficient and effective structure and systems that is supportive of the university’s goals and objectives, sans bureaucratic practices.</li>
    </ul>
